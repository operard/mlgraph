Machine Learning Workshop with Oracle Graph


## Introduction
Explore how to build a Bank Fraud Detection engine using Oracle Graph on a real-world dataset residing in Oracle Autonomous Database.


## About this workshop 

This workshop walks you through the steps to build a Bank Fraud Detection engine using Oracle Graph on a real-world dataset residing in Oracle Autonomous Database. You will access to a bank dataset, use Graph Server, create a Property Graph data model, perform graph visualization and graph analysis.

## Workshop Details

### Step 1: Convert from Relational Data Model to Property Graph Data Model.



### Step 2: Use Open Source Apache Zeppelin with PGX Interpreter and Groovy.


### Step 3: Use Python to access to Oracle Graph “PyPGX”.


### Step 4: Apply Queries to detect Ring Patterns in the Graph Data Model


### Step 5: Connect Third-Party Library Vis.JS from Python.


### Step 6: Use PGX Visualizer.
