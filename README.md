Machine Learning Workshop with Oracle Graph


## Introduction
Explore how to build a Bank Fraud Detection engine using Oracle Graph on a real-world dataset residing in Oracle Autonomous Database.


## About this workshop 

This workshop walks you through the steps to build a Bank Fraud Detection engine using Oracle Graph on a real-world dataset residing in Oracle Autonomous Database. You will access to a bank dataset, use Graph Server, create a Property Graph data model, perform graph visualization and graph analysis.

## Workshop Details

To demonstrate the Oracle Graph functionalities, the workshop has been divided in different steps.

<p>The manual to execute the workshop step by step is available
<a href="https://github.com/operard/mlgraph/blob/main/doc/WORKSHOP_MLGraph.pdf">here</a>
</p>

### Step 1: Convert from Relational Data Model to Property Graph Data Model.



### Step 2: Use Open Source Apache Zeppelin with PGX Interpreter and Groovy.


### Step 3: Use Python to access to Oracle Graph “PyPGX”.


### Step 4: Apply Queries to detect Ring Patterns in the Graph Data Model


### Step 5: Connect Third-Party Library Vis.JS from Python.


### Step 6: Use PGX Visualizer.


## Conclusions

<p>In this workshop, we have seen how you can reuse and convert a 3FN relational data model in order to apply Queries and Machine Learning algorithms using the same Oracle Database.</p>
<p>This functionality is available in order to apply fast use cases on the relationships between entities.</p>
